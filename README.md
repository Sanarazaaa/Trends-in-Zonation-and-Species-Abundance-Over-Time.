## **Project Title: Trends in Species Abundance Over Time**

### **Overview**
This project analyzes trends in species abundance and zonation levels over a series of years using a dataset. The analysis aims to understand ecological shifts and the factors influencing species distributions.

### **Requirements**
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`


### **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is in CSV format and contain the following columns:
- **Year**: The year of observation.
- **Species**: The species name.
- **Zonation Level**: The zonation classification.
- **Abundance**: The count or measure of abundance for each species.

Make sure to replace `'dataset - Sheet1.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset file.
